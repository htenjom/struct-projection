//Choices:
//1. Pure reflection R//Expensive and possibly hard
//2. Map struct to JSON and operate over the JSON string R// Great and useful but overkill
//3. Map struct to map -> filter -> map to JSON R// First approach but difficult for nested structures
//4. Use libs with before behavior:
// 	 - copier || deepcopier: useful for same structure, but no more complex if required https://github.com/jinzhu/copier
//   - mapstruct: https://github.com/mitchellh/mapstructure useful but for other purposes when knowing fields is required
//5. Manual mapping with functions R//ItÂ´s easier, doesn't require additional libs, faster than json manipulation and flexible.
